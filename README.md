# mod_insightjournal – Insight Journal for Moodle

[![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/71Professor/moodle-mod_insightjournal/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/71Professor/moodle-mod_insightjournal/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Version 1.0.0 · August 2026 · Moodle 4.5+**

`mod_insightjournal` is a Moodle activity module for focused reflection tasks and
questions. Each activity holds one task or question. Learners write and save their
own response, can return to edit it, and can open a printable personal summary of
all their journal entries across the course. Each learner decides for themselves,
per entry, whether trainers may see it. Trainers track course-wide progress and
can export to CSV, but only ever see the entries their authors chose to share.

> **Version 1.0.0 — first stable release.** Feedback from educators and Moodle
> developers is still very welcome — see the [Feedback](#feedback) section below.

A detailed German user guide is available at
[`docs/Reflexionstagebuch_Plugin_Dokumentation.md`](docs/Reflexionstagebuch_Plugin_Dokumentation.md).

## Installation

### Recommended: install the release ZIP

1. Download the `mod_insightjournal-v…zip` file from the latest
   [GitHub release](https://github.com/71Professor/moodle-mod_insightjournal/releases).
   Its root folder is already named `insightjournal`, as the Moodle installer requires.
2. In Moodle, go to **Site administration → Plugins → Install plugins**, upload the
   ZIP and follow the installer — the database installation runs automatically.

Alternatively, unzip the release ZIP into the `mod/` directory of your Moodle
installation (so the path is `mod/insightjournal/`) and visit
**Site administration → Notifications**.

### From a Git checkout

Clone the repository into `mod/insightjournal/` and visit
**Site administration → Notifications**.

> **Note:** GitHub's *Code → Download ZIP* button packs the plugin into a folder
> named `insightjournal-main`. If you install from that ZIP instead of a
> release ZIP, rename the unpacked folder to `insightjournal` first — otherwise the
> Moodle installer rejects it.

### After installing

- Purge caches after changing language strings, templates, or AMD JavaScript
  (**Site administration → Development → Purge caches**).
- For production JavaScript builds, run Moodle's AMD build from the Moodle root:

  ```bash
  npx grunt amd
  ```

  In development environments with `$CFG->cachejs = false` this step is not required.

**Requirements:** Moodle 4.5+ · PHP 8.1+ · No Composer or Node.js runtime dependencies.

## Trainer Workflow

1. In a course, choose **Add an activity or resource → Insight Journal**.
   The standard **Common module settings → Group mode** control is
   available like any other activity — see [Reports](#reports) for how it
   affects report visibility.
2. Enter the activity **name** (shown in the course navigation).
3. Enter the **Task / Question** — the reflection question or task for learners.
4. Optionally set a **Task / Question background colour** (a hex code, e.g. `#ffcc00`) to
   set it visually apart from the learner's response, wherever it is shown. A native
   colour-picker swatch next to the field (JavaScript required) offers a visual way to
   pick the colour instead of typing the hex code; without it, the hex field works exactly
   as before.
5. Optionally enable **autosave** (response is saved after a pause in typing).
6. Optionally set a **minimum character count** as an activity completion condition,
   and/or a **maximum character count**, enforced with a live counter as learners type.
   The minimum only gates completion — learners can always save a shorter response,
   it simply will not count as complete yet.
7. In the **Activity completion** settings, keep *Learner must save an Insight Journal
   response* enabled when saved responses should mark the activity complete.
8. After the course runs, open the **activity report** to review entries for one task/question,
   or the **course report** for progress across all Insight Journal activities. Each
   learner decides for themselves whether their own entry is visible to trainers —
   see [Data and Privacy](#data-and-privacy).

---

## Learner Workflow

Learners open the activity, read the task/question, write a response using Moodle's
rich-text editor, and save manually. A live word count is shown next to the
response regardless of whether a maximum character count is configured, purely
informational. If autosave is enabled, the response is
saved after a short pause in typing.
Learners can reopen and edit their saved response at any time. Next to the
response is a **"Keep this entry private (only visible to you)"** checkbox,
unticked by default, so trainers can read the entry unless the learner opts
out. Toggling it saves immediately, and it can be changed again at any time —
see [Data and Privacy](#data-and-privacy). Each save checks
that no newer version was saved elsewhere in the meantime (e.g. from another
tab); if one was, the save is rejected with a notice, further saving is
locked, and the learner's own draft stays visible next to the current saved
version so they can compare before reloading to continue. The personal
summary page lists all their Insight Journal
responses in the course and is suitable for browser printing (including
save-as-PDF).

## Capabilities

| Capability                       | Default roles                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `mod/insightjournal:addinstance` | Editing teacher, Manager                    |
| `mod/insightjournal:view`        | Student, Teacher, Editing teacher, Manager   |
| `mod/insightjournal:submit`      | Student                                     |
| `mod/insightjournal:viewown`     | Student, Teacher, Editing teacher, Manager  |
| `mod/insightjournal:viewall`     | Teacher, Editing teacher, Manager           |
| `mod/insightjournal:export`      | Teacher, Editing teacher, Manager           |

Moodle's core `moodle/site:accessallgroups` capability (Editing teacher,
Manager by default) also affects this plugin: without it, a viewer in a
Separate-Groups activity only sees their own group's participants in
reports — see [Reports](#reports).

Moodle's core `moodle/site:viewuseridentity` capability (Teacher, Editing
teacher, Manager by default) also affects this plugin: without it, or if
the site admin has removed `email` from **Show user identity**, a
viewer's reports show no participant email address — see
[Reports](#reports).

The course-wide report (`coursereport.php`) evaluates `mod/insightjournal:submit`
once at course context to decide who appears as a participant row at all;
overriding it at a specific activity's own module context changes whether
that one activity's cell is writable, but not the participant list itself
— see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations).

---

## Reports

- **`report.php`** — activity-level report with participant search, CSV
  export (requires `mod/insightjournal:export`), and pagination (20 per
  page by default, adjustable via a `perpage` URL parameter).
- **`coursereport.php`** — course-level progress report across all Insight
  Journal activities, with CSV export (also requires
  `mod/insightjournal:export`, checked per activity), paginated the same
  way as the activity report.
- **`summary.php`** — personal or trainer-selected learner summary; suitable for
  browser printing. Each of the viewer's own, still-writable entries shows a
  "Go to entry" link straight back to that activity. A trainer can also link
  this page directly from a course section (e.g. a URL resource pointing at
  `summary.php?courseid=<id>`) instead of routing learners through an activity
  first — no extra configuration needed, since `summary.php` handles its own
  access checks.
- **Separate Groups mode is respected on all three pages above.** A viewer
  without the core `moodle/site:accessallgroups` capability in an activity
  running Separate Groups mode sees (or, for `summary.php`, may open) only
  their own course group's participants. Visible Groups and No Groups
  never restrict. The activity's own settings form gains the standard
  "Group mode" setting for this, same as any other Moodle activity.
- **Participant email addresses are only shown to viewers who are allowed
  to see them.** `report.php` shows, searches, and exports a participant's
  email only when the viewer holds Moodle's core
  `moodle/site:viewuseridentity` capability *and* the site has `email`
  configured in **Site administration → Users → Permissions → User
  policies → Show user identity**; `coursereport.php`'s CSV export is
  gated the same way (it never showed email on screen or offered search).
  Table/CSV layout is unchanged either way - the email cell is simply
  blank when not permitted.

---

## Data and Privacy

Insight Journal responses can contain sensitive personal content. The plugin stores:

- activity configuration in `insightjournal`;
- learner responses in `insightjournal_entries`:
  `userid`, response text, response format, visibility, creation time, and modification time.

The Privacy API declares stored data, exports user responses, and deletes all data
for a module context, a single approved user, or approved user lists.
CSV exports are restricted by capability; spreadsheet-formula values are prefixed
to reduce CSV injection risk.

Each entry has its own visibility choice, made **only by the learner who wrote
it** — a **"Keep this entry private (only visible to you)"** checkbox on the
response form, unticked by default (visible to trainer). The learner can change
it at any time, and trainers have no setting anywhere that can override it. With
an entry marked private, the activity report, course report, and personal
summary pages stay reachable to anyone with `mod/insightjournal:viewall`, but
show a notice instead of that entry's content; CSV export replaces only that
row with the notice rather than blocking the whole export. This applies to
every role, including managers and site admins — there is no bypass. Different
learners in the same activity can choose differently; the reports and summary
reflect this per entry rather than hiding a whole page or column.

## Backup and Restore

Moodle backup includes activity settings. Learner entries are included only when
user data is included in the backup. Restore maps user IDs through Moodle's restore
mapping and skips entries when the mapped user is unavailable.

---

## Testing

Recommended local test flow:

1. Install the plugin in a Moodle 4.5+ development site.
2. Create a course with at least one teacher and two students.
3. Add two Insight Journal activities: one with autosave enabled, one disabled.
4. As a student: save a response, reload the activity, edit it, confirm completion
   updates (check the completion condition with minimum characters, if set).
5. As a teacher: open the activity report, search by participant, page
   through results, download CSV.
6. Open the course report, page through participants, and verify progress
   counts.
7. Open a learner summary as the learner and as a teacher with `viewall`;
   confirm the learner sees a "Go to entry" link on their own entries and the
   teacher sees none.
8. Run Moodle backup and restore — once with user data, once without.
9. Run privacy export and deletion for a test user.
10. Run PHP lint, Moodle Code Checker, PHPUnit, PHPStan, and Behat where available.

PHPUnit tests are in `tests/` and cover the custom completion rule, lib
callbacks, the `save_entry` external function, the paginated activity
report table, and the Privacy API provider.

PHPStan (level 5) is configured via `phpstan.neon` and requires the
[`micaherne/phpstan-moodle`](https://packagist.org/packages/micaherne/phpstan-moodle)
extension installed in the Moodle checkout being analysed
(`composer require --dev micaherne/phpstan-moodle`), plus `phpstan-bootstrap.php`
to load a real site. Run from the Moodle root:
`vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c mod/insightjournal/phpstan.neon`. CI runs this
automatically on one representative branch (`MOODLE_500_STABLE`); a new type
error there fails the build. There is no baseline file — production code is
clean at level 5 with every finding resolved at its source rather than
suppressed (one remaining case, `moodleform_mod::standard_intro_elements()`'s
`$customlabel` docblock being wrong in Moodle core itself, is handled with a
narrowly-scoped, explained `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` comment at that one
call site). A second config, `phpstan-tests.neon`, analyses two files under
`tests/` (this plugin's own PHPUnit generator and Behat step definitions —
the rest of `tests/` isn't statically analysable without PHPUnit's own
bootstrap) and gates the build the same way the production step does; there
is no continue-on-error here.

Behat scenarios are in `tests/behat/insight_journal.feature` and cover a
plain form submit with no JavaScript, a no-JavaScript save conflict
re-showing the learner's draft instead of discarding it, the save/reload
roundtrip, editing a previously saved response, autosave persisting a
change without leaving edit mode, the minchars completion regression, a
successful save never showing the error status, a learner marking their
own entry private, saving/the character counter/autosave with the Atto
editor and with the plain textarea editor, a learner choosing differently
across two activities in the same course, a stale save being rejected as
a conflict that locks further saves until the learner reloads, both
reports' pagination, the prompt colour picker staying in sync with the
hex field, and the live word counter (including that it does not merge
words across a `<br>`/paragraph boundary). Run via
`php admin/tool/behat/cli/run.php --tags=@mod_insightjournal`
after `php admin/tool/behat/cli/init.php --scss-deprecations` (the flag
matters: it's what CI's own Behat run checks for deprecated CSS classes,
and is easy to omit locally without noticing).

---

## Known Limitations

- **No native Moodle Mobile App addon** (`db/mobile.php` is not provided). The
  activity is usable in the app via its responsive web view; native in-app editing
  is planned for a later version.
- **No server-side PDF export.** The summary page uses the browser print dialog.
  A direct PDF download is planned for a later version.
- **Behat coverage is limited**: twenty-four scenarios cover a plain
  no-JavaScript form submit, a no-JavaScript save conflict re-showing the
  learner's draft instead of discarding it, the save/reload roundtrip,
  editing a saved response, autosave, the minchars completion regression,
  a learner marking their own entry private, choosing differently across
  two activities in the same course, the Atto editor and the plain
  textarea editor, the save-status classes, a save conflict locking
  further saves until reload, both reports' pagination, Separate Groups
  restriction across all three report/summary surfaces, two scenarios
  proving Separate Groups restriction cannot leak across activities with
  different groupings, the JavaScript character counter matching the PHP
  visible-character count on every shared fixture, a teacher without
  permission to view user identity seeing no participant email, the
  prompt colour picker staying in sync with the hex field, and the live
  word counter (including not merging words across a line/paragraph
  boundary). Course-wide CSV export has real PHPUnit integration coverage
  instead (`tests/coursereport_csv_export_test.php`, driving the actual
  export code against a real `csv_export_writer`) — not literal
  browser-driven end-to-end coverage, since `csv_export_writer::download_file()`
  calls `exit()`, which rules that out; Behat coverage for it specifically
  is not yet automated.
- **Two navigation links share the label "Insight report"**: the activity
  settings navigation link to the per-activity report (`report.php`) and the
  on-page button to the course-wide report (`coursereport.php`) use the same
  text, which can be confusing when both are visible on the same page.
  Cosmetic only — found while adding Behat coverage for the per-activity
  visibility override (2026-07-09); no functional impact. Planned: give the
  course-wide link a distinct label (e.g. "Course insight report", matching
  its own page heading).
- **`minchars` counts a response's DOM text length**, not "meaningful"
  characters: a response containing a single visible character alongside
  a large amount of invisible padding (zero-width characters, non-breaking
  spaces, etc.) reaches the configured minimum, since only a response that
  is *entirely* invisible content counts as empty. This is a deliberate,
  narrowly-scoped design decision (see the `insightjournal_visible_char_count()`
  docblock in `locallib.php`), not an oversight — a trainer who wants to
  fully rule out this edge case has no built-in setting for it today.
- **The course report's participant list evaluates `mod/insightjournal:submit`
  once at course level**, not per activity. If a trainer overrides that
  capability at a specific Insight Journal instance's own module context
  (e.g. to restrict who can write to one particular activity), the course
  report's row selection and pagination don't reflect that override — only
  that activity's own cell visibility does. A deliberate scope decision,
  not an oversight; module-level `submit` overrides are an uncommon
  customization.

## Feedback

All feedback is welcome — whether you are evaluating it as a developer or as a trainer.

**Particularly interested in:**

- Is the trainer workflow intuitive enough inside Moodle?
- Are there features missing for real-world use?
- Does autosave behave as expected? Does the completion condition work correctly?
- Any issues with specific Moodle versions, themes, or role configurations?
- Code review: anything that violates Moodle coding standards or best practices?
