and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Versions map to the `$plugin->release` value in `version.php`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- **`amd/src/autosave.js` and `amd/src/summary.js` are now native ESM modules**
  (`import`/`export`) instead of AMD `define()`/`return`, addressing the R5-10
  review finding. Moodle still fully supports AMD, but recommends ESM for new
  community code; both files' internal logic is unchanged, only the module
  wrapper. `core/ajax` and `core/notification` (still AMD-authored in this
  Moodle version) are imported via a default import, `core/str`'s `get_string`
  via a named import, matching the pattern Moodle core itself uses for mixed
  AMD/ESM dependencies. The `TinyAdapter`'s lazy, optional load of
  `editor_tiny/editor` now uses a dynamic `import()` instead of an inline
  `require()`. Both modules export their public functions as named exports
  (`init`, and `visibleCharCount`/`wordCount` for autosave.js) rather than a
  single default-exported object - `$PAGE->requires->js_call_amd()` generates
  `amd.{function}(...)` calls straight off the required module, and the Behat
  step helper (`tests/behat/behat_mod_insightjournal.php`) reads
  `autosave.visibleCharCount`/`.wordCount` the same way, so a default-only
  export would have left both silently broken at runtime. The local
  `Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration` phpcs exception stays on both
  files: it turned out to fire on every multi-line function expression, not
  just the AMD `define()` wrapper, so removing the wrapper did not remove the
  underlying phpcs/ESLint contradiction as the review anticipated.
  `promptcolor.js` (a third AMD file with the same exception, added after this
  review) was deliberately left on AMD/`define()` - out of R5-10's scope.
  No intended behavior change - confirmed by the full Behat suite (24/24
  scenarios, 365/365 steps) passing unchanged across Tiny, Atto, and the
  plain textarea editor.

## [0.9.0-beta] - 2026-08-06

### Security

- **Group-based authorization now respects a group's own visibility
  setting** (`GROUPS_VISIBILITY_ALL`/`MEMBERS`/`OWN`/`NONE`), addressing
  the R5-01 review finding. The R4-03 memory-bounded rework replaced
  Moodle's own `groups_get_all_groups(..., $withmembers = true)` - which
  enforces group visibility internally - with direct `groups_members`
  queries that checked only raw group-id membership. Course backup/restore
  inserts group rows without re-validating that a group's visibility and
  `participation` flag are consistent (`groups_create_group()` normally
  enforces this pairing, but restore's raw insert bypasses it), so a
  restored course could legitimately contain a non-ALL-visibility group
  that the affected functions treated as fully visible anyway. Fixed by
  applying `core_group\visibility::sql_member_visibility_where()` - the
  same predicate Moodle core itself uses - at all three affected call
  sites, gated behind the same `moodle/course:viewhiddengroups` bypass
  core always pairs it with, so a Teacher/Editing teacher/Manager (which
  hold that capability by default) sees exactly what they did before this
  fix.

### Changed

- **Group-based authorization (activity report, course report, summary)
  no longer materialises every allowed group's full member list**,
  addressing the R4-02 and R4-03 review findings. The two functions this
  used to go through, `insightjournal_current_user_groups()` and
  `insightjournal_current_user_group_userids()`, fetched every member of
  every group a viewer could see, regardless of how much of that data any
  single request actually needed - a course report page rendering 20 rows
  still resolved membership for every group member in the course, once per
  activity, before pagination even started; they also accepted an unused
  optional `$cm = null` course-wide legacy fallback that no production
  caller had needed since R3-01/R3-02. Both functions are gone entirely
  now, replaced by group-id-based checks: the activity report filters via
  a `groups_members` existence subquery, summary checks a single target
  user via one existence query, and the course report resolves membership
  only for the userids on the current page or CSV chunk (with the
  allowed-group-ids lookup itself cached per grouping) - see also the
  R5-01 fix below, which closed a group-visibility gap in these same
  queries. No change to who sees what beyond that fix - this was a
  memory/query-scaling change, not a feature change.
- **The course-wide report's authorization, paging, progress-counting, and
  export-row-selection logic now lives in one place**, addressing the
  R4-04 review finding. `coursereport.php` previously ran the same
  participant-x-activity authorization loop twice - once for its CSV
  export, once for its on-screen page - with slightly different output
  handling in each copy. Both now call a single `coursereport_provider`
  service (`classes/local/coursereport_provider.php`) that resolves
  participants and per-cell visibility/completion/privacy once; each
  renderer only decides what to do with an unauthorized cell (the screen
  masks it, the CSV export omits the row). No change to what's shown or
  exported - this is a structural refactor, not a feature change.
- **PHPStan's baseline is gone; both of its two suppressed findings are now
  resolved at their source instead**, addressing the R4-07 review finding.
  `classes/local/entry_manager.php`'s `format_text()` calls now cast their
  format argument to `int` explicitly (one of them read from the entry's
  own `responseformat` instead of re-hardcoding `FORMAT_HTML` a second
  time). `mod_form.php`'s `standard_intro_elements()` call carries a
  narrowly-scoped, explained `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` for a genuine
  Moodle core docblock bug (its `@param null $customlabel` is wrong; the
  method fully supports, and core itself elsewhere passes, a string
  label). CI also gained a second, deliberately non-blocking "PHPStan
  (tests)" step that analyses `tests/` for the first time - it currently
  reports ~300 findings, almost all unresolvable PHPUnit/Moodle
  test-framework noise, which is exactly why it's non-blocking rather than
  baselined. No behavior change.
- **Every `get_string()`/`addHelpButton()` call now uses the full
  `mod_insightjournal` frankenstyle component name**, addressing the CR-03
  review finding. The codebase previously mixed the short `insightjournal`
  form (39 call sites) with the full `mod_insightjournal` form (already
  used elsewhere, e.g. throughout `amd/src/autosave.js`); Moodle accepts
  both interchangeably for a module's own strings, so this is purely a
  consistency cleanup, not a behavior change. Unrelated uses of the bare
  `insightjournal` string (the DB table name, the `mod/insightjournal:*`
  capability prefix, the retired site setting's stored config key read by
  the upgrade migration) were deliberately left untouched.
- **The `minchars` help text and trainer docs now say explicitly that it
  only gates completion, never saving**, addressing the CR-04 review
  finding. A learner can always save a shorter response; it simply will
  not count as complete until it reaches the configured length. No
  behavior change - documentation only (form help text, README, German
  user guide).
- **The release workflow now re-verifies the checked-out commit and pins
  its third-party actions to full commit SHAs**, addressing the R4-06
  review finding. The existing pre-checkout tag verification resolves
  `refs/tags/$TAG` by name again during the actual `actions/checkout`
  step rather than reusing the already-verified SHA, leaving a narrow
  window where a tag force-moved in between would have been silently
  checked out and released; a new step right after checkout re-compares
  the real `git rev-parse HEAD` against the CI-validated SHA and fails
  closed on any mismatch. `actions/checkout` and
  `softprops/action-gh-release` are now pinned to their exact resolved
  commit SHAs (with a version comment) rather than movable major-version
  tags.
- **`amd/src/autosave.js`'s TinyMCE-specific logic is now isolated behind
  a small `TinyAdapter` object**, addressing the R4-08 review finding.
  The module previously reached into `editor_tiny`-specific state and its
  `getInstanceForElementId()` API from two separate places; both now go
  through `TinyAdapter.instanceFor()`, and every other editor's contract
  (keep the backing textarea's `.value` continuously in sync) is
  documented in one place instead of implied. Pure refactor, no intended
  behavior change - confirmed by the full Behat suite passing unchanged
  across Tiny, Atto, and the plain textarea editor.
- **CI no longer runs twice for the same commit on a branch with an open
  PR**, addressing the rest of the R4-10 review finding. `ci.yml`'s push
  trigger was unrestricted, so pushing to a feature branch that already
  had a PR open against it fired both a `push`-event run and a
  `pull_request`-event run for the identical commit. The push trigger is
  now restricted to `main` and version tags (`v*`); `pull_request` stays
  unrestricted so every PR still gets CI regardless of branch or fork.
  Tag pushes are still covered directly, since `release.yml`'s
  `workflow_run` trigger specifically needs a push-triggered CI run for
  the tag. As a side effect this also cuts down on the release workflow
  firing (and immediately no-op-skipping) for every redundant CI
  completion.
- **The response poll's `setInterval` is now stopped once a save conflict
  occurs**, addressing the CR-05 review finding. Previously it kept
  ticking every second for as long as the tab stayed open after a
  conflict, even though every tick from then on was a guaranteed no-op
  (recovery requires a full page reload via the conflict banner). No
  user-visible behavior change.
- **The autosave debounce (3000ms) and poll interval (1000ms) in
  `amd/src/autosave.js` are now named constants** at the top of the
  module, addressing the CR-06 review finding, instead of bare numeric
  literals at their two use sites.
- **The `tests/` PHPStan check now gates the build instead of always
  passing**, addressing the R5-07 review finding. The previous version
  analysed the whole `tests/` directory and reported ~300-350 permanently
  unfixable findings (PHPUnit/Moodle test-framework magic that's only
  resolvable inside PHPUnit's own bootstrap), so CI ran it with
  `continue-on-error` - not a real quality signal. Fixed the 3 findings
  that were real (not framework noise: a docblock missing a leading `\`
  before `stdClass`, and two instances of a Moodle core docblock bug -
  `@param \int[]`, a meaningless backslash on a scalar type - already
  worked around once before for a similar case in R4-07), then rescoped
  the check to exactly the two files under `tests/` that don't need
  PHPUnit's bootstrap and are genuinely 0-error at level 5 (this plugin's
  own PHPUnit generator and Behat step definitions). A real, if narrower,
  gate now, not noise.
- **CI dependencies are pinned more thoroughly**, addressing the R5-11
  review finding: `actions/checkout`, `shivammathur/setup-php`, and
  `actions/upload-artifact` in the main CI workflow (previously only done
  for the privileged release workflow) are now pinned to full commit SHAs,
  and `moodle-plugin-ci`'s previously-open `^4` version range is now
  pinned to its currently-resolved exact version, matching the existing
  `micaherne/phpstan-moodle` pinning rationale.
- **4 of 5 PHPUnit deprecation notices are resolved**, addressing the rest
  of R5-11: coverage-only docblock annotations (`@covers`/`@coversNothing`,
  in `backup_test.php` and the three template test files) migrated to
  their PHP attribute equivalents, matching the pattern already used
  elsewhere in this codebase. The remaining one (`locallib_test.php`'s
  `@dataProvider`) is deliberately kept in its docblock form, documented
  in place: unlike coverage attributes, `#[DataProvider]` controls actual
  argument binding and silently no-ops on PHPUnit 9.6 (the
  `MOODLE_405_STABLE` CI leg still runs it) - a real regression this
  project already hit once, in R4-01.

### Added

- **A native colour picker next to the prompt colour hex field on the
  activity settings form**, addressing the CR-07 review finding, kept in
  sync with the hex text field by a new small `mod_insightjournal/promptcolor`
  AMD module: picking a colour fills the hex field, typing a valid hex
  updates the picker. The picker is never itself submitted (no `name`
  attribute) and a browser without colour-input support - or JS disabled
  entirely - simply shows the hex text field alone, unchanged.
- **A live word count next to the character counter** while writing a
  response, addressing the CR-08 review finding - purely informational,
  shown regardless of whether a maximum character limit is configured
  (unlike the character counter, which only appears when one is set). The
  count correctly treats a `<br>` or paragraph boundary as a word
  separator (e.g. a Shift+Enter line break) rather than merging the
  adjacent words together - deliberately not reusing the character
  counter's own HTML-to-text extraction, which collapses such boundaries
  to nothing as an accepted, tested PHP/JS parity trade-off that a word
  count has no reason to inherit.

### Fixed

- **Deleting all entries via course reset now also resets completion**,
  addressing the CR-01 review finding. `insightjournal_reset_course_userdata()`
  previously deleted the entries but left each affected learner's completion
  state untouched, so an activity a learner had already completed stayed
  marked complete indefinitely even though the entry that earned it was
  gone. Completion is now recalculated (`completion_info::reset_all_state()`)
  for every insight journal instance in the course right after its entries
  are deleted.
- **A response consisting only of whitespace, non-breaking spaces, or
  zero-width characters is now correctly treated as empty**, addressing
  the R4-01 review finding. Previously, `insightjournal_visible_char_count()`
  and the completion "has any content" check could disagree on emptiness
  for such input (e.g. a single non-breaking space), letting it satisfy
  `minchars` and mark the activity complete even though the response
  looked blank. The live character counter now shows `0` for such input
  too, matching the server exactly - proven with a shared PHP/JS fixture
  table exercised by both PHPUnit and a real-browser Behat test, rather
  than only asserted in a comment. Interior whitespace/NBSP next to real
  text is unaffected. `DOMDocument` parsing also now sets `LIBXML_NONET`.
- **An invalid `promptcolor` value can no longer reach the database**,
  addressing the CR-02 review finding.
  `insightjournal_normalise_promptcolor()`
  only prepended `#` and lowercased its input, relying entirely on
  `mod_form::validation()` to reject bad values - a programmatic caller
  (e.g. restore, or a future admin script) bypassing the form could send
  something like `not-a-color` straight through to the `CHAR(7)` column,
  overflowing it and throwing a `dml_write_exception` instead of failing
  gracefully. The normaliser now applies the same regex as
  `insightjournal_prompt_style()` and maps anything that fails it to `''`,
  so every write path is guarded, not just the form.
- **A stale template comment describing the conflict-reload link's click
  handler is now accurate**, addressing part of the R4-10 review finding.
  `templates/view.mustache` still said the handler called
  `window.location.reload()`; that was replaced by href-based navigation
  in an earlier fix (to avoid resubmitting the no-JS conflict page's POST)
  and the actual `autosave.js` comment was updated at the time, but this
  template comment was missed. Comment only, no behavior change.
- **`coursereport_provider::csv_rows()` now rejects a chunk size below 1**,
  addressing the R5-09 review finding. `get_enrolled_users()` treats a
  limit of `0` as "no limit," so a `0` chunk size would have silently
  fetched every participant in one unbounded chunk while the loop's own
  offset/exit-condition logic could never terminate - an infinite loop,
  not just a theoretical edge case. Also validates every diary id passed
  in against the provider's own activities upfront, failing with a clear
  `coding_exception` instead of an undefined-array-key warning deep inside
  the row-building loop if they're ever out of sync.

### Testing

- **The course report's CSV export now has a real integration-test proof**
  (PHPUnit driving the actual `coursereport_provider::csv_rows()` code
  path against a real `csv_export_writer`, not a full browser/HTTP
  download - `csv_export_writer::download_file()` calls `exit()`, which
  rules out a true browser-driven test), closing the R4-09 review finding:
  two independent groupings each stay
  isolated for a group-restricted viewer, a private entry inside an
  authorized cell always shows the privacy notice rather than its real
  text, a viewer holding `moodle/site:accessallgroups` (but belonging to
  no group at all) sees every grouping in full, a response containing a
  comma, an embedded quote, and a real paragraph break round-trips
  byte-for-byte through a real `csv_export_writer`, and five participants
  exported at a chunk size of two (three chunks) all appear exactly once,
  with none dropped or duplicated at a chunk boundary. The CSV
  chunk-iteration loop itself moved from `coursereport.php` into a new
  `coursereport_provider::csv_rows()` method (continuing the R4-04
  extraction) so these tests exercise the exact same code the real export
  runs, not a reimplementation of its chunking. No behavior change.
- **A new Behat scenario proves autosave, manual save, and the character
  counter all work with the plain textarea editor** (no rich-text plugin
  active at all), addressing the R4-08 review finding's "unknown editors
  degrade without data loss" acceptance criterion with a real end-to-end
  proof rather than code inspection alone - it already passed before the
  `TinyAdapter` refactor, confirming the existing fallback behavior was
  correct. Tiny (the default, untagged editor in every other
  `@javascript` scenario) and Atto already had equivalent coverage.

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **The activity now fires Moodle's standard events**, addressing the
  R2-09 review finding: `course_module_viewed` on every activity view,
  and new `entry_created`/`entry_updated` events on every successful
  entry save (never on a save that's rejected as a conflict). This makes
  activity show up in Moodle's standard activity log (**Reports → Logs**)
  and become available to any log-consuming plugin (analytics,
  notifications, etc.), which previously showed nothing for this
  activity at all. Purely additive and server-side; no visible change to
  any page. Note that `entry_updated` fires once per autosave as well as
  per manual save, so an actively-typing learner can generate multiple
  log rows per session.

### Fixed

- **The activity report's Separate Groups restriction is now scoped to
  the activity's own grouping and only counts participation-eligible
  groups**, closing the R3-01 review finding. Previously, a teacher
  without `moodle/site:accessallgroups` was restricted to their group's
  members course-wide - including members of groups tied to a
  *different* grouping than the one this activity actually uses, and
  including groups flagged as not participation-eligible. Both could
  make the report show (or hide) participants outside the activity's
  own group configuration. On an upgrading site, this is a *narrowing*
  change: a viewer with no participation-eligible group in this
  activity's own grouping now correctly sees no participants at all in
  that activity's report, where they may previously have seen their
  course-wide group's members. `coursereport.php`'s and `summary.php`'s
  equivalent checks are fixed the same way by R3-02, immediately below.

- **`summary.php` and `coursereport.php` now authorize per activity,
  not course-wide**, closing the R3-02 review finding. Both pages
  previously computed a single course-wide "is the viewer group-
  restricted anywhere" flag and applied it uniformly to every activity
  the viewer could otherwise see - so a viewer's group membership
  relevant to *one* activity's grouping could grant visibility into a
  *different* activity's grouping in the same course. Both pages now
  decide visibility per activity: `summary.php` only queries the
  activities where the target user is actually visible under that
  activity's own grouping; `coursereport.php` masks individual cells
  (and drops CSV rows) per activity, removing a participant's row
  entirely only when they are authorized for none of the visible
  activities. `report.php` was already fixed this way in R3-01. Unlike
  R3-01, this isn't purely a narrowing change: in a course mixing an
  unrestricted activity with a Separate-Groups one, `coursereport.php`'s
  participant list can now correctly *widen* too - a participant
  previously filtered out by the old course-wide restriction (which
  wrongly applied even to the unrestricted activity) may now appear,
  since an unrestricted activity's own visibility is never group-limited.

- **The release workflow no longer trusts a `v`-prefixed branch/PR name
  alone**, addressing the R3-03 review finding. `ci.yml` runs on both
  `push` and `pull_request`, so a branch or PR merely *named* like a
  release tag (e.g. `v9.9.9-evil`) previously satisfied the release job's
  entire gate once its CI run completed. The job now also requires the
  triggering run to be a `push` from this repository (not a fork), and a
  new pre-checkout step queries the remote directly to confirm a real git
  tag exists and resolves to exactly the commit CI validated, failing
  closed otherwise; checkout then uses that verified tag ref instead of a
  bare SHA. No effect on a normal tagged release - only closes a spoofing
  path nothing in this project's history has actually exploited.

- **The course-wide report's CSV export now streams participants in
  bounded chunks (500 at a time) instead of loading every enrolled
  participant and every entry across all of its activities into memory at
  once**, closing the R3-04 review finding - the root cause of this
  report's long load times on large courses. Output and column layout are
  unchanged; only memory use during the export is now bounded independent
  of course size, the same property `report.php`'s CSV export already got
  from its `table_sql` migration in R2-04. The entries lookup shared by
  both the on-screen pagination and the CSV export is now a single
  `insightjournal_entries_by_diary_and_user()` helper in `locallib.php`,
  replacing two near-identical inline queries.

- **A save conflict on the no-JavaScript form-submit path no longer
  discards the learner's unsaved draft**, closing the R3-05 review
  finding. Previously, a rejected (conflicting) save via a plain POST
  submit redirected straight back to the activity view, silently
  replacing the learner's just-typed text with whatever was already
  stored on the server. The page now re-renders immediately instead: the
  learner's own draft stays in the editor, a conflict notice is shown
  alongside the server's actual current content (mirroring the AJAX/JS
  path's existing conflict banner), and an explicit "Reload page" link is
  offered to discard the draft and adopt the server's version instead.
  Clicking Save again either succeeds (if nothing else changed in the
  meantime) or reports a fresh conflict.

- **A genuine database write failure during save is no longer mislabeled
  as an ordinary save conflict**, closing the R3-06 review finding.
  `entry_manager::save()`'s backstop for a brand-new entry racing with a
  write from outside its own lock (the only realistic source is a course
  restore inserting entries directly) used to catch *any*
  `dml_write_exception` from either an insert or an update and report it
  as a conflict - including a genuine, unrelated DB error (deadlock,
  connection loss). Now: an update failure always propagates as a real
  error (an update can never legitimately race on the unique index the
  way a brand-new insert can); an insert failure is only reported as a
  conflict once a row is confirmed to actually exist for that (activity,
  learner) pair - anything else propagates too. No visible change for the
  overwhelming majority of saves; a genuine DB error at save time now
  surfaces as an actual error instead of a misleading "someone else saved
  a newer version" message.

- **The server now counts "visible characters" for minchars/maxchars the
  same way the learner's live character counter does**, closing the R3-08
  review finding. The counter in `amd/src/autosave.js` strips markup via a
  browser `textContent` (no separators added between paragraphs or list
  items); the server's minchars/maxchars checks and completion tracking
  previously measured length via `insightjournal_html_to_text()`, which
  deliberately inserts blank lines between paragraphs and `"* "` bullet
  markers for list items - readable for CSV export/display, but longer
  than what the learner actually saw counted while typing. Most noticeable
  for multi-paragraph or list-formatted responses, a natural way to write
  a longer reflection: previously, such a response could be silently
  rejected as over `maxchars` (or fail to reach `minchars` for completion)
  even though the client's own counter showed it within range. New
  `insightjournal_visible_char_count()` in `locallib.php` is now used
  everywhere a length is compared against minchars/maxchars;
  `insightjournal_html_to_text()` is unchanged and still used for display
  and emptiness checks, where the added formatting is intentional.

### Changed

- **Reports no longer show a participant's email address to a viewer who
  isn't allowed to see it.** `report.php` used to select and expose
  `u.email` unconditionally - on screen, in participant search, and in CSV
  export; `coursereport.php` only in its CSV export (it never showed email
  on screen or offered search). Email now only appears when the viewer holds
  Moodle's `moodle/site:viewuseridentity` capability *and* the site admin
  has kept `email` in **Site administration → Users → Permissions → User
  policies → Show user identity**, addressing the R2-06 review finding. On
  a default-configured site with the standard teacher/editing
  teacher/manager roles, this is invisible - nothing changes. It only
  matters for a restricted role or a site that has customised its
  identity-field configuration. Table and CSV column layout are unchanged
  either way; only the email value goes blank when not permitted.
  `summary.php`'s user fetch also drops a similarly-unconditional `email`
  selection that turned out to be entirely unused.

- **`coursereport.php`'s CSV export now uses Moodle's `csv_export_writer`
  instead of a hand-written `fputcsv()` loop**, addressing the R2-12 review
  finding. Two visible effects: it now begins with a UTF-8 byte-order mark
  (BOM), matching `report.php`'s CSV export (previously the two reports'
  CSV exports differed in this one respect — see the 0.7.1-beta entry
  below); and its formula-injection escaping (a leading `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`
  gets a defensive `'` prefix, per OWASP's CSV-injection guidance) now also
  catches a value with leading whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) before
  that character, which the plugin's own previous hand-rolled check did not
  catch. If you parse this export programmatically, read it as
  UTF-8-with-BOM (e.g. Python's `csv` module needs `encoding='utf-8-sig'`,
  not plain `'utf-8'`) - otherwise a check like `row[0] == 'courseid'` will
  now fail against the BOM-prefixed first cell. The export's `Content-Type`
  also changes from `text/csv; charset=utf-8` to plain `text/csv`, matching
  `report.php`'s CSV export. Column layout and content are otherwise
  unchanged. The activity report's own CSV export (`report_table.php`)
  already went through Moodle's core writer since 0.7.1-beta and needed no
  equivalent fix — its now-redundant manual escaping calls were simply
  removed.

- **The course-wide report's per-learner progress count ("X / N") now
  counts a private entry as done**, closing the R3-09 review finding.
  Previously it excluded private entries entirely, undercounting real
  completed work and disagreeing with the activity's own Moodle completion
  tracking (`custom_completion.php`), which never checked privacy in the
  first place. Only the aggregate count changes - a private entry's
  per-cell status, timestamp, and content stay exactly as hidden from the
  trainer as before.

- **CI's Moodle Code Checker no longer disables
  `Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration` across the whole plugin**,
  closing the R3-10 review finding. The sniff's contradiction with ESLint's
  `space-before-function-paren` rule (see the 0.7.1-beta entry below) only
  ever applied to `amd/src/autosave.js`/`summary.js`'s specific style; it's
  now suppressed with inline `phpcs:disable`/`phpcs:enable` comments in
  just those two files, so the sniff still protects every other file in
  the plugin (all PHP files, and any future AMD module that doesn't share
  this particular contradiction).

- **CI's PHPStan step now installs a pinned `micaherne/phpstan-moodle`
  version (`1.1.0`) instead of an unconstrained `composer require`**,
  closing the R3-11 review finding. An unpinned install could silently
  pick up a new, potentially breaking release on whatever day CI happens
  to run next, turning the step red with no corresponding change in this
  repository.

### Testing

- **Closed every test-coverage gap R2-11 identifies except one
  sub-item**, per the 2026-07-27 follow-up review: a save attempt
  without the `mod/insightjournal:submit` capability is now
  regression-tested end to end (rejected, writes nothing, fires no
  event); resubmitting an already-rejected stale save a second time is
  proven to fail again server-side; a non-editing teacher without
  `accessallgroups` in Separate Groups mode is now covered by an
  integration-level test that exercises the real `report.php` wiring,
  not just its underlying helpers in isolation; and course
  backup/restore is now verified to preserve an entry's `response`,
  `revision`, and `visibility` values and to exclude entries entirely
  when "Include user data" is off. No behaviour changed — this is
  coverage only. The one remaining sub-item (a direct regression test
  proving the R2-09 restore-mapping fix registers a queryable mapping)
  was investigated and found technically infeasible against Moodle's
  public API — its temp bookkeeping table is dropped inside
  `execute_plan()` itself — and is logged as an accepted gap, consistent
  with the same call already made for this exact mapping when R2-09
  shipped it.

## [0.7.1-beta] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- **The activity report (`report.php`) and course-wide report
  (`coursereport.php`) now paginate** instead of loading every matching row
  in one request (20 per page by default, adjustable via a `perpage` URL
  parameter), addressing the R2-04 review finding. The activity report is
  now built on Moodle's `table_sql` API
  (`classes/table/report_table.php`), which also brings its CSV export
  in-house (previously a hand-written loop) — the exported CSV's 9-column
  format is unchanged. Both reports' CSV exports are unaffected by
  pagination and continue to export every matching row.

- **The activity report's CSV export now begins with a UTF-8 byte-order
  mark (BOM)**, a side effect of moving its export onto Moodle's own CSV
  writer (see above) for better default Excel compatibility. The
  course-wide report's CSV, still written by hand, is unaffected and has
  no BOM — the two reports' CSV exports are not currently byte-identical
  in this one respect. Unifying both onto the same writer is left to a
  future pass (R2-12).

- **The activity report's empty state** (no entries, or a search matching
  nothing) now shows Moodle's standard "Nothing to display" notification
  instead of the plugin's own "No entries yet." message, as a side effect
  of the `table_sql` migration above. The now-unused `noentries` string is
  deprecated (`lang/en/deprecated.txt`) rather than removed outright, per
  Moodle's convention of keeping a deprecated string's definition in place
  for at least one more release before deleting it; it is slated for
  actual removal in a later release.

- **The activity report, course-wide report, and learner summary page now
  respect Moodle's Separate Groups mode** (addressing the R2-05 review
  finding). A teacher without the `moodle/site:accessallgroups` capability
  in a Separate-Groups activity now sees only their own group's
  participants — previously every report showed every participant
  regardless of group mode. The activity's own edit form also gains the
  standard "Group mode" setting (`FEATURE_GROUPS` is now declared), so
  trainers can set it per-activity, not only via the course default. Only
  Separate Groups restricts; Visible Groups and No Groups are unaffected,
  matching every other Moodle activity's behaviour.

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **Closed a lost-update race in autosave that the previous optimistic-concurrency
  check alone did not prevent.** Server: `save_entry`'s read-compare-write is now
  serialised per entry (activity + user) via the Moodle Lock API, so two genuinely
  concurrent saves can no longer both read the same revision and both write; the
  loser is now reliably told about the conflict instead of occasionally winning a
  race. Client: on a rejected save, `autosave.js` now enters an explicit conflicted
  state instead of quietly adopting the server's revision as its new write base —
  it discards any queued save, disables further auto/manual saves, and shows the
  server's actual current content next to the still-editable, still-copyable local
  draft, with a "Reload page" action as the only way to resume saving. Previously,
  the very next autosave tick or manual click after a conflict could silently
  overwrite the other writer's newer text with the same stale local content that
  had just been rejected.

- **Declared the `revision` column in the Privacy API metadata**, with an
  English/German description, and included it in the user's data export
  alongside the other stored fields. It was added to `insightjournal_entries`
  for optimistic-concurrency saves but never documented as personal data.

### Changed

- **The response field is now a standard Moodle form (`classes/form/entry_form.php`)
  instead of a hand-wired rich-text editor.** `view.php` no longer calls
  `editors_head_setup()`/`use_editor()` directly, no longer requires
  `repository/lib.php` itself, and no longer needs the `return_types` option
  (dead in practice, since file/image attachments were already disabled via
  `maxfiles => 0`) — the standard `editor` form element handles all of that
  internally. A plain form submit now works with JavaScript disabled entirely,
  saving via the same code path as autosave: the actual save logic (the
  per-entry lock, the revision check, the completion update) moved out of
  `save_entry` into a shared `entry_manager` service that both the AJAX
  external function and the new form submission call. No change for
  JavaScript-enabled sessions: autosave, the character counter, the conflict
  banner, and the view/edit toggle all work exactly as before. The response
  field itself is now rendered by Moodle's standard form markup (label above
  the field, in the usual Moodle form styling) rather than the previous
  compact custom layout.

## [0.6.0-beta] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **The personal summary page (`summary.php`) now shows a "Go to entry" link
  on each entry the viewer owns and can still submit to**, jumping straight
  to that activity's page to make changes, instead of requiring a trip back
  through the course.

### Changed

- **Entry visibility is now decided per entry by the entry's author, not by
  the trainer.** The former per-activity "Trainer visibility for this
  activity" setting is removed from the activity settings form entirely —
  trainers can no longer see or change it. Instead, each learner's response
  form has a "Keep this entry private (only visible to you)" checkbox,
  unticked by default (visible to trainer), which they can change at any
  time; toggling it saves immediately. Adds a `visibility` column to
  `insightjournal_entries` and a required `private` parameter on the
  `save_entry` external function; removes the `entriesvisibility` column
  from `insightjournal` (upgrade steps included). Existing activities that
  were set to "Private" have their existing entries migrated to private so
  that guarantee is preserved; everything else defaults to visible, matching
  a freshly written entry.

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Optimistic-concurrency protection when saving an entry.** Every save now
  carries the revision it was based on; if the entry has since been saved
  elsewhere (another tab, another device) the save is rejected with a "Not
  saved: a newer version was saved elsewhere" notice instead of silently
  overwriting the newer text. Adds a `revision` column to
  `insightjournal_entries` (upgrade step, existing rows backfilled to `1`)
  and a new required `expectedrevision` parameter on the `save_entry`
  external function.
- Two new Behat scenarios: a successful manual save never shows the error
  status class, and saving/the character counter/autosave all work with the
  Atto editor instead of Tiny. Suite is now 8 scenarios (was 6).

### Changed

- `insightjournal_entries_visible_to_teacher()` now **fails closed**: an
  unexpected, legacy, or missing `entriesvisibility` value is treated as
  **not** visible to the trainer. Previously such a value was treated as
  visible. This only affects rows left with an unresolved value.
- The upgrade step that migrated the retired site-wide "Visible to trainer"
  setting now resolves each activity from what that old setting actually
  was, instead of unconditionally marking every legacy row visible; a
  missing or unrecognised old value now resolves to private.

### Fixed

- Learner responses no longer hard-depend on the Tiny editor: `autosave.js`
  requests `editor_tiny/editor` lazily and falls back to the plain textarea
  value when Tiny isn't the active editor, so autosave and the character
  counter keep working on sites using Atto or the plain text editor.
- The response editor no longer contradicts itself by enabling file
  management (`enable_filemanagement`) while `maxfiles` is `0`, which showed
  a non-functional "manage files" control in Atto.

## [0.4.1-beta] - 2026-07-17

First release published as a tagged GitHub Release with an installable ZIP.
Collects everything since 0.2.0-beta.

### Added

- **GitHub release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): pushing a
  version tag (`v*`) builds an installable plugin ZIP whose root folder is
  named `insightjournal` — as the Moodle installer requires — and publishes it
  as a GitHub Release. The workflow fails if the tag does not match
  `$plugin->release` in `version.php`. This removes the need to manually
  rename the folder from GitHub's *Code → Download ZIP* archive
  (`moodle-mod_insightjournal-main`).
- **New per-activity setting: Trainer visibility for this activity** (`entriesvisibility`: Visible to trainer / Private), set by the course
  teacher who creates or edits an Insight Journal activity. Defaults to
  "Visible to trainer", so existing activities keep today's behaviour. With
  "Private", learner entries are visible to the learner who wrote them only:
  the activity report, course report, and personal summary pages remain
  reachable to trainers with `mod/insightjournal:viewall`, but show a notice
  instead of entry content, and CSV export is blocked. Applies uniformly to
  every role, including managers and site admins — there is no bypass. The
  course report and personal summary reflect this per activity (e.g. one
  activity's entries can be private while another's stay visible in the same
  course), instead of a single page-wide notice. There is deliberately no
  site-wide setting; visibility is a per-activity decision.
- Help buttons (contextual `_help` strings) for the activity settings
  `Task / Question`, `Enable autosave`, and `Minimum characters for completion`,
  in English and German.
- PHPUnit test suite (`tests/`): custom completion rule, lib callbacks, the
  `save_entry` external function, and the privacy provider, plus a test data
  generator. Includes regression tests for both completion fixes below.
- PHPStan static analysis (`phpstan.neon`, `phpstan-bootstrap.php`, level 5),
  using the `micaherne/phpstan-moodle` extension for Moodle-aware class/global
  resolution. One pre-existing Moodle core PHPDoc inaccuracy
  (`moodleform_mod::standard_intro_elements()` documents its `$customlabel`
  parameter as `null`-only even though passing a string is the documented,
  intended use) is baselined in `phpstan-baseline.neon` rather than worked
  around in our code.
- Behat acceptance tests (`tests/behat/insight_journal.feature`): the
  save/reload roundtrip and the minchars completion regression, run against
  Firefox via Selenium.
- Learner responses now use Moodle's site-configured rich-text editor
  (matching the existing prompt field) instead of a plain textarea, with a
  view/edit toggle: a saved response renders read-only with an "Edit"
  button, and "Save" returns to the read-only view. Responses are stored as
  HTML (`FORMAT_HTML`) going forward; `minchars`/`maxchars` and the
  `completionentries` completion rule are measured against visible
  characters (HTML tags stripped), not raw markup length. No image/file
  embedding is supported.
- Optional `promptcolor` activity setting: a hex colour code (e.g. `#ffcc00`)
  used as the background of the task/question box, on both the activity
  view and the personal summary page. Never affects the learner's response.
  Blank (the default) keeps today's appearance unchanged.
- Continuous integration via GitHub Actions using
  [moodle-plugin-ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci)
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push and pull request runs phplint,
  phpmd, the Moodle Code Checker (phpcs), PHPDoc checks, plugin validation,
  upgrade-savepoint checks, Mustache lint, Grunt, PHPUnit, and Behat across a
  matrix of PHP 8.1–8.4, Moodle 4.5 LTS through `main`, and
  PostgreSQL/MariaDB. Contributed by Jonathan Champ (@jrchamp) — thanks!
  (PR #9)

### Changed

- **Repository layout cleaned up for maintainability**: development-only files
  (`docs/`, `phpstan.neon`, `phpstan-baseline.neon`, `phpstan-bootstrap.php`,
  `.github/`, Git metadata) are excluded from release ZIPs and GitHub source
  archives via `export-ignore`, so an installed plugin folder contains only
  runtime files; internal working documents were removed from the repository;
  the German user guide moved from the repository root to
  `docs/Reflexionstagebuch_Plugin_Dokumentation.md`.
- Installation instructions (README and German guide) now recommend the
  release ZIP from the GitHub Releases page and document that a folder
  unpacked from GitHub's *Code → Download ZIP* must be renamed to
  `insightjournal` before installing.
- Renamed the activity setting label from **Insight prompt** to **Task /
  Question** (German: **Aufgabe / Frage**) for clarity, including its help
  text and the related **Task / Question background colour** setting
  (formerly **Prompt background colour**). The underlying `prompttext` and
  `promptcolor` field names are unchanged, so no database upgrade is needed.
- Accessibility: the autosave status now lives in an ARIA live region
  (`role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"`) so screen readers announce
  save progress, and the response field is associated with the minimum-character
  hint via `aria-describedby`. The deprecated Bootstrap 4 class `sr-only` has
  been replaced with `visually-hidden`, which Moodle 4.5 already supports via
  its Bootstrap 5 bridge; `input-group-append` is kept intentionally for
  Moodle 4.5 (Bootstrap 4) and remains valid on Moodle 5.0 via its
  compatibility layer. (PR #9)
- Code style aligned with the Moodle `phpcs` coding standard across all PHP
  files, now enforced by CI: consistent spacing after type casts, multi-line
  array formatting, and alphabetically sorted language strings (English and
  German, no wording changes). JavaScript in `amd/src/` now passes Moodle's
  ESLint rules and the `amd/build/` bundles were rebuilt via Grunt, including
  a proper source map for `summary.min.js`. (PR #9)

### Notes

- No dedicated Moodle Mobile App addon (`db/mobile.php`) in this release; the
  activity is usable via its responsive web view in the app.

### Fixed

- Two Behat scenarios still configured the site-wide `entriesvisibletoteacher`
  setting that was removed when visibility became a per-activity decision,
  breaking the acceptance test run. They now set `entriesvisibility` on the
  activity instead. Found by the new CI. (PR #9)
- `insightjournal_get_coursemodule_info()` now exposes the `completionentries`
  custom completion rule to core completion via
  `customdata['customcompletionrules']`. Previously the rule was never reported,
  so automatic completion was never evaluated and the rule description never
  appeared for learners. Found during live testing on Moodle 5.0.2.
- `save_entry` now passes `COMPLETION_UNKNOWN` to `update_state()` so core
  recalculates completion via `custom_completion::get_state()`. Previously it
  forced `COMPLETION_COMPLETE`, which bypassed the `minchars` rule (any save,
  even an empty or too-short response, marked the activity complete and it never
  reverted). Found during browser UI testing on Moodle 5.0.2.
- `view.php`, `save_entry`, `custom_completion::get_state()`, and
  `insightjournal_get_coursemodule_info()` now explicitly `require_once` Moodle's
  `completionlib.php` before using `completion_info` or any `COMPLETION_*`
  constant, matching the convention used throughout Moodle core (e.g.
  `mod/page/view.php`). That library is never autoloaded or included by Moodle's
  bootstrap; production code was only working by incidentally relying on some
  other part of the same request already having loaded it. Found by actually
  executing the PHPUnit suite for the first time (moodle-docker, Moodle 5.0.8),
  which has no such incidental load and failed with `Undefined constant` errors.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2026-06-17

First beta release. Targets Moodle 4.5+ (`$plugin->requires = 2024100700`),
maturity `MATURITY_BETA`.

### Added

- Insight Journal activity module: one insight prompt per activity instance.
- Learner workflow: write, manually save, and later edit a personal response,
  with optional autosave after a pause in typing.
- Optional minimum character count as an activity completion condition.
- Activity report (`report.php`) with participant search and capability-gated
  CSV export; spreadsheet-formula values are prefixed to reduce CSV injection risk.
- Course-level progress report (`coursereport.php`) across all Insight Journal
  activities in a course.
- Personal/trainer learner summary (`summary.php`), suitable for browser printing.
- Capabilities: `addinstance`, `view`, `submit`, `viewown`, `viewall`, `export`.
- Privacy API provider: metadata declaration, user-data export, and deletion for
  module context, a single approved user, and approved user lists.
- Moodle backup/restore support, including learner entries when user data is
  included; restore maps user IDs and skips entries for unavailable users.
- English and German language packs.
